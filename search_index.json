little book\nI like researching debugging techniques, so I decide to write this booklet to introduce strace. The following is the official definition of strace:  \n\nstrace is a diagnostic, debugging and instructional userspace utility for Linux. It is used to monitor and tamper with interactions between processes and the Linux kernel, which include system calls, signal deliveries, and changes of process state.\nSystem administrators, diagnosticians and trouble-shooters will find it invaluable for solving problems with programs for which the source is not readily available since they do not need to be recompiled in order to trace them.\nThe operation of strace is made possible by the kernel feature known as ptrace.  \n\nIn one word, strace helps you know a process's activities between user-space and kernel-space. Let's check a simple example to get first impression of strace:  \n# strace ls\nexecve(\"/usr/bin/ls\", [\"ls\"], 0x7ffe7727eec0 /* 20 vars */) = 0\nbrk(NULL)                               = 0x560a32cda000\narch_prctl(0x3001 /* ARCH_??? */, 0x7fff167898f0) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)\naccess(\"/etc/ld.so.preload\", R_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/ld.so.cache\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3\nfstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=98317, ...}) = 0\nmmap(NULL, 98317, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0) = 0x7face703c000\nclose(3)                                = 0\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/usr/lib/libcap.so.2\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3\n......\nstrace outputs all the syscalls' names, arguments, and return values. Very cool, isn't it? OK, let's begin our journey now.\n"},"posts/show-help-message-and-version.html":{"url":"posts/show-help-message-and-version.html","title":"Show help message and version","keywords":"","body":"Show help message\nAs other *NIX commands, -h option shows a concise help message of strace:  \n# strace -h\nusage: strace [-CdffhiqrtttTvVwxxy] [-I n] [-e expr]...\n              [-a column] [-o file] [-s strsize] [-P path]...\n              -p pid... / [-D] [-E var=val]...

The format of expression is:  \n[qualifier=][!][?]value1[,[?]value2]...\nQualifier can be trace (or t), abbrev(or a), verbose (or v), raw (or x), signal/signals (or s), read/reads (or r), write/writes (or w), fault, inject, or kvm.

The accuracy of the heuristic can be gauged by timing a given program run without tracing (using time(1)) and comparing the accumulated system call time to the total produced using -c.  \n\nCheck the source code:  \n    ......\n    ts_mul(&dtv, &overhead, counts[i].calls);\n    ts_sub(&counts[i].time, &counts[i].time, &dtv);\n    ......\nThe overhead time is subtracted from the total consuming time, and this option just makes sure the measure of time spent on system calls to be more accurate.\n"},"posts/align-return-value-column.html":{"url":"posts/align-return-value-column.html","title":"Align return value column","keywords":"","body":"Align return value column\nBy default, the alignment column for results is 40:  \n# strace ls\nexecve(\"/usr/bin/ls\", [\"ls\"], 0x7ffca1e1f070 /* 21 vars */) = 0\nbrk(NULL)                               = 0x55c6d34e2000\narch_prctl(0x3001 /* ARCH_??? */, 0x7ffd28e4cd10) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)\naccess(\"/etc/ld.so.preload\", R_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/ld.so.cache\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3\nfstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=98317, ...}) = 0\nmmap(NULL, 98317, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0) = 0x7f6ebc2ae000\nclose(3)                                = 0\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/usr/lib/libcap.so.2\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3\n......\n-a option can be used to adjust the alignment:  \n# strace -a 80 ls\nexecve(\"/usr/bin/ls\", [\"ls\"], 0x7fffe93ef0d0 /* 21 vars */)                     = 0\nbrk(NULL)                                                                       = 0x562a6bfa1000\narch_prctl(0x3001 /* ARCH_??? */, 0x7ffd332954c0)                               = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)\naccess(\"/etc/ld.so.preload\", R_OK)                                              = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/ld.so.cache\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC)                        = 3\nfstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=98317, ...})                            = 0\nmmap(NULL, 98317, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0)                                 = 0x7f2f8fd22000\nclose(3)                                                                        = 0\n......\nTune this parameter according to your screen or your habit.\n"},"posts/the-end.html":{"url":"posts/the-end.html","title":"The end","keywords":"","body":"The end\nThis manual refers strace's manual and code.
